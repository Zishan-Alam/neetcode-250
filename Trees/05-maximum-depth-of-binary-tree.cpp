/*
🧠 Intuition:
We calculate the maximum depth of a binary tree using recursion.  
For every node, we find the depth of its left and right subtrees and take the maximum.  
Each recursive call goes one level deeper, so when the recursion unwinds,  
we get the total height of the tree.

⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n)
Each node is visited exactly once.

💾 Space Complexity: O(h)
Where h is the height of the tree (O(n) in worst case for skewed tree, O(log n) for balanced tree).

/*
🧠 Intuition:
Level order traversal (BFS) use karke hum tree ko level by level traverse karte hain.
Har level complete hone par height (depth) ek se badha dete hain.
Jab tak queue khali nahi hoti, matlab aur levels baaki hain.

⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n)
→ Har node ek baar process hota hai.

💾 Space Complexity: O(n)
→ Queue me maximum ek level ke nodes store hote hain (worst case: complete binary tree).
